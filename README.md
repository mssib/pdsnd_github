### Project Title
Bikeshare Data Exploration

### Description
In this project, the used data is provided by Motivate (a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States), 
to uncover bike share usage patterns between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.
the project is an interactive experience as a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal 
that answers questions about the dataset. The experience is interactive because depending on a user's input, 
the answers to some statistical questions will change due to four questions that will change the answer:
 1- Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?
 2- Would you like to filter the data by month, day, or not at all?
 3- (If they chose month) Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?
 4- (If they chose day) Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?
