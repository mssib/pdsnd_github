### Project Title
Bikeshare Data Exploration

### Description
In this project, the used data is provided by __Motivate__ (a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States),
to uncover bike share usage patterns between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.  
the project is an interactive experience as a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal
that answers questions about the dataset. The experience is interactive because depending on a user's input,
the answers to some statistical questions will change due to four questions   that will change the answer:
- Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?
- Would you like to filter the data by month, day, or not at all?
- (If they chose month) Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?
- (If they chose day) Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?
